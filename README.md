Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Create a random number. Print the number.

```
Hint:
import random
randomNumber = random.randint(0,9)
```

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
Create a function that will loop until the user enters '0'. Ask the user to enter a positive integer number. Print 0 to that number and ask them again to enter a number until they enter '0'. Repeat.

### Problem 4:
Create a function that creates a random number. Ask the user to guess the random number. Keep letting the user guess until they get it right, then quit. If they don't get it right, tell them if their next guess has to be higher or lower.
