# Python Basics: Math and String Formatting

### Problem 1:
Write some Python code that has three variables called ```greeting```, ```my_name```, and ```my_age```. Intialize each of the 3 variables with an appropriate value, then rint out the example below using the 3 variables and two different approaches for formatting Strings. 

1) Using concatenation and the ```+``` and 2) Using an ```f-string```. Sample output:

```
YOUR_GREETING_VARIABLE YOUR_NAME_VARIABLE!!! I hear that you are YOUR_MY_AGE_VARIABLE today!
```

### Problem 2:
Write some Python code that asks the user for a secret password. Create a loop that quits with the user's quit word. If the user doesn't enter that word, ask them to guess again.

### Problem 3:
Write some Python code that prints 0 to 100, printing each number three times per row.
ex.
```
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4
5 5 5
.
.
.
```

### Problem 4:
Write some Python code that creates a random number from 1 - 10 and stores it in a variable. Ask the user to guess the random number. Keep letting the user guess until they get it right, then quit. Print the message ```Sorry, incorrect``` for each wrong guess.
#### Extra:
But the range for the secret random number to 1 - 100. For each wrong guess, include a clue to the Guesser as to if their missing guess was 'too low' or 'too high'.

### Challenge
Write some Python code to ask the user to create a number for the computer to guess between 1 - 10000. Write the code so that the computer guesses random numbers between 1 - 10000 and will keep guessing until the computer guesses the number correctly. Once the computer guesses the random number, alert the user with an alert box that displays how many guesses it took to guess the random number.
